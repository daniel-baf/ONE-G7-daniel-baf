# Currency Exchange Rate API Project 💱

Welcome to the repository for my Currency Exchange Rate project. This project utilizes the ExchangeRate API to fetch and display currency conversion rates, allowing users to understand the current exchange rates between different currencies.

## Overview 📝

This project connects to the ExchangeRate API, which provides real-time currency conversion rates. It enables users to input a base currency and a target currency, retrieving and displaying the current exchange rate for that pair.
